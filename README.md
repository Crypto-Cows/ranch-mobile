We want to enter the world of NFTs with our collection of 10.000 NFTs then we are here to stay and keep going with our goals that are to become game-changers in the NFTs environment.

# What you will find in this repository?
We are supporters of the open source code, we will publish all the source codes of every application and smart contract that will be released.

The main reasons we do this are:
- Ensure transparency.
- For educational purposes.
- To encourage other developers to take a cue from our applications and perhaps release better versions of our applications.
